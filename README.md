# Centered Google Search

A lightweight Chrome extension that centers Google Search results and the top header, making it easier to browse on large or ultrawide monitors.

## 💡 Why?

By default, Google Search results are left-aligned, which can feel awkward on large displays. This extension fixes that by applying simple CSS rules to center the main content and header.

## ✨ Features

- Center-aligns the main Google Search result container
- Also centers the top bar (search input + tabs)
- Minimal, clean code (only two files)
- No permissions needed

## 📦 Installation

- Clone or download this repository.
- Go to chrome://extensions/ in your Chrome browser.
- Enable Developer Mode (top-right corner).
- Click “Load unpacked” and select the extension folder.

You’re done! Google search results will now be centered automatically.
